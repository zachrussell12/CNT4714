********I HAVE CHOSEN TO DO THE BONUS PROBLEM FOR THIS PROJECT********

All screenshots for the commands are included in the top level of the project under the file named:
	
	Project4CmdTestCases-Russell.pdf

All commands are included in the document.

**THE HOMEPAGE FOR THIS PROJECT IS localhost:8080/Project4/rootHome.jsp **

Here you will be able to login as a root or client user.

Root Login Information:

	Username: root
	Password: adminDB

Client Login Information:

	Username: client
	Password: client

Depending on which user you are will limit your capabilities in the database, root users have full capabilites, while client users can only issue select statements. 

The main interface JSP page that communicates with the servlet is localhost:8080/Project4/root.jsp , if you try to go to this page directly without logging in you will be re-directed to the login page.
